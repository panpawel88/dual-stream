# FFmpeg Video Player Application

## Project Requirements

- C++ application for Windows 10/11
- Build system: CMake with FFmpeg 7.1.1 download from gyan.dev during generation
- Input: Paths to 2 video files via command line arguments (MP4 container, H264/H265 codec)
- Video files must have identical resolutions (error and exit if different)
- Hardware decoding using NVIDIA RTX GPU (NVDEC) with software fallback
- Console notification when software decoding is used instead of hardware
- DirectX 11 rendering with decoded frames as DX11 textures
- Fixed window size matching video resolution (non-resizable)
- Seamless video switching with keyboard keys (1 and 2)
- Auto-play with individual video looping (each video restarts itself at end)
- Synchronized timestamp when switching between videos
- Minimal resource usage - decode on-demand, not in advance
- No audio support currently, but architecture flexible for future separate audio file

## Application Architecture

### Core Components
1. **CMake Build System** - Downloads FFmpeg binaries and sets up dependencies
2. **Video Decoder Manager** - Handles hardware decoding with NVDEC to DX11 textures
3. **Dual Stream Manager** - Manages two video streams with seamless switching
4. **DirectX 11 Renderer** - Renders decoded frames to window
5. **Input Handler** - Processes keyboard input for video switching
6. **Frame Synchronizer** - Maintains proper timing and seeks to keyframes

### Key Technical Features
- Hardware decoding using NVIDIA's NVDEC API through FFmpeg
- Direct DX11 texture output from decoder (avoiding CPU-GPU memory transfers)
- Intelligent buffering strategy for seamless switching
- Keyframe-aware seeking for proper decode state
- Minimal resource usage with on-demand decoding

### Memory Management Strategy
- Decode frames just-in-time, not in advance
- Maintain small buffer around current playback position
- Pre-seek inactive video to current timestamp when switching
- Release unused decoder contexts promptly

### Error Handling Strategy
- Validate identical video resolutions at startup (exit with error if different)
- Exit with error message if video files are corrupted, missing, or incompatible
- Graceful fallback from hardware to software decoding with console notification
- Clear error messages for all failure scenarios

6. âœ… Create video demuxer class for MP4 containers with H264/H265 support
7. âœ… Implement hardware decoder wrapper with DX11 texture output
8. âœ… Set up DirectX 11 rendering pipeline for video textures
9. âœ… Create dual video manager for handling two synchronized video streams
10. âœ… Implement seamless video switching with keyframe-aware seeking
11. âœ… Add keyboard input handling (keys 1 and 2 for video switching)
12. ðŸ”„ Implement frame timing, synchronization, and individual video looping

## Implementation Notes

The application will:
- Accept two video file paths via command line arguments
- Validate that both videos have identical resolutions at startup
- Create a fixed-size window matching video resolution (non-resizable)
- Start with the first video in auto-play mode
- Allow instant switching between videos (keys 1 and 2) while maintaining synchronized timestamps
- Loop each video individually when it reaches the end
- Use hardware decoding (NVDEC) when available, with console notification for software fallback
- Leverage GPU hardware acceleration with direct DX11 texture output for optimal performance
- Maintain architecture flexibility for future separate audio file support
