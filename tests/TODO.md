# DualStream Video Player - Testing System TODO

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete the comprehensive testing system for the dual-stream video player.

## üìä Current Status Summary

**‚úÖ WORKING:** Basic test system compiles and runs successfully
- Simple functionality tests: 3/3 passing (100%)
- Build targets: `simple_test`, `run_basic_tests`, `run_all_tests`, `run_performance_tests`
- Location: `build/bin/Release/simple_test.exe`

**‚úÖ WORKING:** JSON configuration system fully restored
- JSON parsing: nlohmann/json v3.11.3 integrated via FetchContent
- Test configuration loading: 4 test suites, 10 individual tests parsed successfully
- Localized dependency: JSON library isolated to tests directory only
- Working executables: `json_test.exe`, `json_config_test.exe`

**‚úÖ WORKING:** Full video testing system restored with modular architecture
- TestRunner.cpp, FrameValidator.cpp, SwitchingValidator.cpp, PerformanceBenchmark.cpp fully operational
- Re-enabled in CMakeLists.txt after modular refactoring
- All video system dependencies resolved through core library linkage
- Working executable: `build/bin/Release/test_runner.exe`

**üéØ COMPLETED:** Full test system restored through modular architecture refactoring

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Modular Architecture Refactoring

### New Build Architecture
The codebase has been successfully refactored into a clean modular architecture:

1. **dual_stream_core (Static Library)**
   - Contains all business logic: video processing, rendering, camera system, UI components
   - All source files except main.cpp moved to this library
   - Proper dependency management with FFmpeg, CUDA, OpenCV, ImGui
   - Shared by both main application and test system

2. **dual_stream.exe (Main Application)**
   - Thin executable containing only main.cpp entry point
   - Links with dual_stream_core static library
   - All functionality preserved, no behavioral changes

3. **test_runner.exe (Test Application)**
   - Links with dual_stream_core static library  
   - Full access to video system components (VideoManager, IRenderer, etc.)
   - No longer needs forward declarations or header workarounds
   - All test files (TestRunner, FrameValidator, SwitchingValidator, PerformanceBenchmark) operational

### Benefits Achieved
- **Resolved all compilation issues**: Test system compiles and links successfully
- **Clean separation**: Library code separated from application entry points
- **Better testability**: Tests can access all video system components directly
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for all business logic
- **Faster builds**: Core library only rebuilds when business logic changes

### Immediate Next Steps to Restore Full Test System (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)

   - ~~Add FFmpeg include paths to test CMakeLists.txt~~
   - ~~Link test executables with main application libraries~~
