## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Core frame extraction and OCR integration (enables basic frame validation)
2. **Phase 2**: Video system integration (enables realistic testing scenarios)
3. **Phase 3**: Performance monitoring (enables comprehensive benchmarking)
4. **Phase 4**: Visual regression and error handling (ensures robustness)
